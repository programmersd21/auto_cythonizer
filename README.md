- ⚡ Caching enabled to speed up repeated builds.
- 🏎️ Multi-threaded scanning of Python files for faster processing.
- 📝 Automatic code annotation for loops and functions to leverage Cython's performance directives.
- 🔍 Missing module detection during build.
- 🔧 Auto-detects installed Python libraries and can fully Cythonize and rebuild them.
- 🚫 Exclude files and folders during build using `exclude.txt` or `.gitignore` style patterns, including wildcards.
- 🧹 Smart cleaning system with `-c` flag that removes build artifacts while keeping the target folder intact.
- 📦 Wheel building and automatic installation with pip.
